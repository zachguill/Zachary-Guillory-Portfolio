    <br>
    <p>
        Have you ever wondered how old your dog is in human years? The common adage is
        "1 year equals 7 dog years,"<br> but that is simply not true. After their first year,
        your dog's age equivilent is about 15 years old. After two years your <br> dog is about 24.
        Each aditional year after that adds 5 years.
